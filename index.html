I am a stranger to them because of my caucasian way of doing things.</p>

          <h2> Motorcycles </h2>
          <img src="images/moto.jpg" class="img-circle"width="400px">
          <p class="text-justify">  My dad is a huge fan of Harley-Davidson. He has always owned a motorcycle. It's as if I was raised on one! So naturally, I became extremely curious about motorcycles and everything that has to do with it. As a family we would attend the motorcycle festival called Burapa in Pattaya every saingle year. When I'll be older, I want to purchase a Ducati, the 2021 Monster in a matte black to be more precise. </p>
